  title : A Predictive, Exploratory and Text Dashboard for Airbnb.
  content : "Airbnb is a community of hosts and travellers, where they can either list a space or book an accommodation anywhere in the world. The data generated by Airbnb provides rich information, including structured data such as price and location, as well as unstructured data such as reviews and listing descriptions. While there are statistical and analytical tools such as JMP to draw insights from these data, these tools are not so intuitive for common user and lack interactivity."
  content: "Thus, this project aims to develop an interface that offers anyone and everyone to make data-driven decision."
