  title : Overview
  content : "The increasing availability of data has resulted in the increased demand for data driven decisions. Although there is an extensive range of commercial statistical tools, they are often subscription-based and demand good technical knowledge to mine and draw insights from. Therefore, it may not appeal to the average user. As such, our project aims to develop a user-friendly application that will enable users to make data-driven decisions without the need to understand programming languages or have extensive statistical knowledge. We will use Airbnb data as our baseline for this project -data generated is rich in information, which consists of– structured, unstructured (textual), and location data. With this application, users will be able to perform text analysis on review and listing data to generate more quantitative insights. The exploratory module allows users to identify interesting patterns based on selected variables. Findings from the exploratory module will be further augmented in the confirmatory module where selection of statistical methods will be guided based on user’s chosen variables. Finally, the prediction module enables users to prepare and build a variety of prediction models without needing to have in-depth understanding of the predictive models and its algorithms. "
