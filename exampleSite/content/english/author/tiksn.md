I have **10** years of experience in software development. I am proficient in *C#*, *.NET*, *Entity Framework \[Core\]*, *ASP.NET MVC \[Core\]*, *OOP/OOD*, *Software Design Patterns*, *TDD*, *Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ)*, *Microservice Architecture*, *Kubernetes*, *Docker*, *PowerShell \[Core\]*. I have experience in Mobile Development in *UWP* and *Xamarin*. Regarding my work habits, I am a focused, goal-oriented worker with a very analytical mind. Frequently, I start independent projects just for fun including my website, framework, apps, and various tools and small utilities. In these projects, I have used technologies that I am interested in but are not used in a corporate environment like *Microsoft Bot Framework*. I work very well with a team, I prefer it compared to working by myself as I love both giving and receiving advice to and from others.
