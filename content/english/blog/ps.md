**A brilliant product that WORKS!!!!**

**PROBAC Pet Stain & Odour Remover will remove and neutrailize bad smells left by those "oops" moments that occur from time to time with your pets.**

>**It will generally remove new urine odours within 30 - 40 seconds. Old and deep seated odours,(those that have seeped through to the underfelt of a carpet) might need a second or sometimes a third application.**

**Stains left behind by those same moments are removed by spraying the affected area with Pet Stain Remover, then gently agitate the area with a brush and allow to dry.**

**Once dry, you can vacuum the area should you wish.**

**Probac's biological action will digest the stain exactly as happens by nature, in nature.**
